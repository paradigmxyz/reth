body: "Fixes the inconsistency where StaticFilesArgs properly uses edge feature defaults but RocksDbArgs was always defaulting to false regardless of the feature flag.\r\n\r\nBefore this, if you compiled with --features edge, you'd still need to manually pass --rocksdb.tx-hash=true to get the actual edge behavior defined in StorageSettings::edge(). Now it just works."
