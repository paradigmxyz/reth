body: "\r\n\r\nThe `reth stage run` command accepted `hashing` and `merkle-changesets` as valid stage arguments, but silently returned without executing them. This created a mismatch between the documented behavior and actual implementation, causing confusion when users attempted to run these stages.\r\n\r\n"
