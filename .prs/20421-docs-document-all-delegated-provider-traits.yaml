body: "Expand the delegate_provider_impls macro documentation to list all traits it delegates to as_ref, including BytecodeReader, StateRootProvider, StorageRootProvider, StateProofProvider and HashedPostStateProvider.\r\n\r\nThis keeps the doc comment aligned with the actual macro expansion and avoids confusion for readers expecting a 1:1 mapping between docs and generated impls."
