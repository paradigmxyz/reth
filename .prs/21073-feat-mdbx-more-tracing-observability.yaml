body: "this PR aims at migrating https://github.com/figtracer/reth-mdbx-profiler into a reth exex\r\n- the codebase would be much smaller \r\n- data would also be 100% accurate, since we wouldn't need to make assumptions based on page fault-ops timing\r\n\r\nfor that i wanted to add a couple of extra tracing spans which may be useful as well for other experiments\r\n\r\nedit: this would probably cause a lot of overhead as well so idk if leaving it in tracing without any feature gate would be a good idea"
