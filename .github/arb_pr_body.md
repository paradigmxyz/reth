# feat(arb-reth): add arb-reth CLI bin scaffold and workspace member

This PR introduces the initial scaffolding for a dedicated arb-reth binary, mirroring op-rethâ€™s structure. This keeps reth modular and avoids forking.

Changes:
- Add crates/arbitrum/bin with a minimal arb-reth entrypoint
- Include crates/arbitrum/bin in workspace members
- Ensure reth builds with and without the arbitrum feature (no behavior change to main reth binary)
