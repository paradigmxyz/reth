# Ignored Tests Configuration
#
# This file contains tests that should be ignored for various reasons (flaky, known issues, etc).
# These tests will be IGNORED in the CI results - they won't cause the build to fail
# regardless of whether they pass or fail.
#
# Format
# test_suite:
#   - "test name 1"
#   - "test name 2"
#
# When a test should no longer be ignored, remove it from this list.
