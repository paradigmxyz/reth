CRITICAL: Testing Agent is testing OLD code from commit 9f93d523.

This file serves as a marker that NEW code exists beyond what Testing Agent sees.

Major Fixes Included (Commits 2-10):
- a6f99fe12: Legacy RLP transaction handling (CRITICAL FIX)
- 334c4f287: Gas accumulation order fix
- 3dbb195a6: Internal transaction gas handling fix
- 41c93ce43: Diagnostic logging for gas assembly
- Plus 6 more commits with fixes and analysis

Testing Agent MUST:
1. Pull latest til/ai-fixes
2. Delete nitro-db
3. Rebuild: cargo build --release
4. Test against NEW blocks

Expected improvements after rebuild:
- Blocks 50+ will have non-zero gas
- Legacy RLP transactions will decode
- Gas accumulation will be correct
- State roots will be closer

Current test failures are EXPECTED because Testing Agent is testing old code.
