//! MDBX implementation of [`OpProofsStore`](crate::OpProofsStore).
//!
//! This module provides a complete MDBX implementation of the
//! [`OpProofsStore`](crate::OpProofsStore) trait. It uses the [`reth_db`] crate for
//! database interactions and defines the necessary tables and models for storing trie branches,
//! accounts, and storage leaves.
