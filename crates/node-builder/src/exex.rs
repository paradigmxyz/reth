// todo: expand this (examples, assumptions, invariants)
//! Execution extensions (ExEx).
//!
//! An execution extension is a task that derives its state from Reth's state.
//!
//! Some examples of state such state derives are rollups, bridges, and indexers.
//!
//! An ExEx is a [`Future`] resolving to a `Result<()>` that is run indefinitely alongside Reth.
//!
//! ExEx's are initialized using an async closure that resolves to the ExEx; this closure gets
//! passed an [`ExExContext`] where it is possible to spawn additional tasks and modify Reth.
//!
//! Most ExEx's will want to derive their state from the [`CanonStateNotification`] channel given in
//! [`ExExContext`]. A new notification is emitted whenever blocks are executed in live and
//! historical sync.
//!
//! # Pruning
//!
//! ExEx's **SHOULD** emit an `ExExEvent::FinishedHeight` event to signify what blocks have been
//! processed. This event is used by Reth to determine what state can be pruned.
//!
//! An ExEx will not receive notifications for blocks less than the block emitted in the event. To
//! clarify: if the ExEx emits `ExExEvent::FinishedHeight(0)` it will receive notifications for any
//! `block_number >= 0`.
//!
