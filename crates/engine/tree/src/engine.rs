///
/// This type is an orchestrator for incoming messages and responsible for delegating requests
/// received from the CL to the handler.
///
/// It is responsible for handling the following:
/// - Delegating incoming requests to the [`EngineRequestHandler`].
/// - Advancing the [`EngineRequestHandler`] by polling it and emitting events.
/// - Downloading blocks on demand from the network if requested by the [`EngineApiRequestHandler`].
///
/// The core logic is part of the [`EngineRequestHandler`], which is responsible for processing the
/// incoming requests.
