//! Behaviour needed to serve `eth_` RPC requests, divided into general database reads and
//! specific database access.
//!
//! Traits with `Load` prefix, read atomic data from database, e.g. a block or transaction. Any
//! database read done in more than one default `Eth` trait implementation, is defined in a `Load`
//! trait.
//!
//! Traits with `Eth` prefix, compose specific data needed to serve RPC requests in the `eth`
//! namespace. They use `Load` traits as building blocks. [`EthTransactions`] also writes data
//! (submits transactions). Based on the `eth_` request method semantics, request methods are
//! divided into: [`EthTransactions`], [`EthBlocks`], [`EthFees`], [`EthState`] and [`EthCall`].
//! Default implementation of the `Eth` traits, is done w.r.t. L1.
//!
//! [`EthApiServer`](crate::EthApiServer), is implemented for any type that implements
//! all the `Eth` traits, e.g. `reth_rpc::EthApi`.
