//! Implementation of a tree-like structure for blockchains.
//!
//! The [`BlockchainTree`] can validate, execute, and revert blocks in multiple competing
//! sidechains. This structure is used for Reth's sync mode at the tip instead of the pipeline, and
//! is the primary executor and validator of payloads sent from the consensus layer.
//!
//! Blocks and their resulting state transitions are kept in-memory until they are persisted.
//!
//! ## Feature Flags
//!
//! - `test-utils`: Export utilities for testing
