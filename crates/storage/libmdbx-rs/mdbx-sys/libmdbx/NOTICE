On 2022-04-15, without any warnings or following explanations, the
Github administration deleted _libmdbx_, my account and all other
projects (status 404). A few months later, without any involvement or
notification from/to me, the projects were restored/opened in the "public
read-only archive" status from some kind of incomplete backup. I regard
these actions of Github as malicious sabotage, and I consider the Github
service itself to have lost trust forever.

As a result of what has happened, I will never, under any circumstances,
post the primary sources (aka origins) of my projects on Github, or rely
in any way on the Github infrastructure.

Nevertheless, realizing that it is more convenient for users of
_libmdbx_ and other my projects to access ones on Github, I do not want
to restrict their freedom or create inconvenience, and therefore I place
mirrors (aka mirrors) of such repositories on Github since 2025. At the
same time, I would like to emphasize once again that these are only
mirrors that can be frozen, blocked or deleted at any time, as was the
case in 2022.
