On 2022-04-15, without any warnings or following explanations, the
Github administration deleted _libmdbx_, my account and all other
projects (status 404). A few months later, without any involvement or
notification from/to me, the projects were restored/opened in the "public
read-only archive" status from some kind of incomplete backup. I regard
these actions of Github as malicious sabotage, and I consider the Github
service itself to have lost trust forever.

As a result of what has happened, I will never, under any circumstances,
post the primary sources (aka origins) of my projects on Github, or rely
in any way on the Github infrastructure.

Nonetheless, taking into account that it is more convenient for users of
my projects to access them on Github, I did not want to restrict their
freedom or create inconvenience, and therefore I posted mirrors on
Github. However, it was noticed that despite the development of
_libmdbx_, free support and consultations, many projects and users
deviated from the rules of a fair deal and instead of helping and
building relationships, they began to adjust links and delete references
in violation of the license. Therefore, in protest against such unworthy
actions, on December 10, 2025, I decided to abandon the placement of
mirrors on Github.
