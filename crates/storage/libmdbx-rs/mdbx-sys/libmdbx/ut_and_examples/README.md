## Examples & Unit tests

This set of examples will be updated, and most of the examples are also publicly available tests.

### C API
The [`example-mdbx.c`](example-mdbx.c) is the example of using the C API.
However, it is strongly recommended to use the modern [C++ API](https://libmdbx.dqdkfa.ru/group__cxx__api.html), which requires less effort
and insures against many errors related to resource leaks.

### Berkeley DB
If you have already used Berkeley DB, then it will be useful to make a line-by-line comparison of [`example-mdbx.c`](example-mdbx.c) and the [`sample-bdb.txt`](sample-bdb.txt) file.
