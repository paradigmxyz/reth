.SH NAME
mdbx_copy \- MDBX environment copy tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mdbx_copy

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B mdbx_copy
utility copies an MDBX environment. The environment can
be copied regardless of whether it is currently in use.
No lockfile is created, since it gets recreated at need.

If
.I dest_path
is specified it must be the path of an empty directory
for storing the backup. Otherwise, the backup will be
written to stdout.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-V
Write the library version number to the standard output, and exit.
.TP
.BR \-q
Be quiet.
.TP
.BR \-c
Compact while copying. Only current data pages will be copied; freed
or unused pages will be omitted from the copy. This option will
slow down the backup process as it is more CPU-intensive.
Currently it fails if the environment has suffered a page leak.
.TP
.BR \-u
Warms up the DB before copying via notifying OS kernel of subsequent access to the database pages.
.TP
.BR \-U
Warms up the DB before copying, notifying the OS kernel of subsequent access to the database pages,
then forcibly loads ones by sequential access and tries to lock database pages in memory.
.TP
.BR \-n
Open MDBX environment(s) which do not use subdirectories.
This is legacy option. For now MDBX handles this automatically.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Exit status is zero if no errors occur.
Errors result in a non-zero exit status and
a diagnostic message being written to standard error.
.SH CAVEATS
This utility can trigger significant file size growth if run
in parallel with write transactions, because pages which they
free during copying cannot be reused until the copy is done.
