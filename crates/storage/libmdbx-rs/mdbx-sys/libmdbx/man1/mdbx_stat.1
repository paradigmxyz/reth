.TP
.BR \-q
Be quiet.
.TP

.TP
.BR \-r
Display information about the environment reader table.
Shows the process ID, thread ID, and transaction ID for each active
reader slot. The process ID and transaction ID are in decimal, the
thread ID is in hexadecimal. The transaction ID is displayed as "-"
if the reader does not currently have a read transaction open.
If \fB\-rr\fP is given, check for stale entries in the reader

a diagnostic message being written to standard error.
