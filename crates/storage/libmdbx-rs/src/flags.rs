    /// This trade-off maintains database integrity, but a system crash may undo the last committed

    /// [`SyncMode::UtterlyNoSync`] the [`SyncMode::SafeNoSync`] flag disable similarly flush
    /// system buffers to disk when committing a transaction. But there is a huge difference in
    /// how are recycled the MVCC snapshots corresponding to previous "steady" transactions
    /// (see below).
    ///
    /// With [`crate::EnvironmentKind::WriteMap`] the [`SyncMode::SafeNoSync`] instructs MDBX to
    /// use asynchronous mmap-flushes to disk. Asynchronous mmap-flushes means that actually
    /// all writes will scheduled and performed by operation system on it own manner, i.e.
    /// unordered. MDBX itself just notify operating system that it would be nice to write data
    /// to disk, but no more.
    ///
    /// Depending on the platform and hardware, with [`SyncMode::SafeNoSync`] you may get a
    /// multiple increase of write performance, even 10 times or more.
    ///
    /// In contrast to [`SyncMode::UtterlyNoSync`] mode, with [`SyncMode::SafeNoSync`] flag MDBX
    /// will keeps untouched pages within B-tree of the last transaction "steady" which was
    /// synced to disk completely. This has big implications for both data durability and
    /// (unfortunately) performance:
    /// - A system crash can't corrupt the database, but you will lose the last transactions;
    ///   because MDBX will rollback to last steady commit since it kept explicitly.
    /// - The last steady transaction makes an effect similar to "long-lived" read transaction
    ///   since prevents reuse of pages freed by newer write transactions, thus the any data
    ///   changes will be placed in newly allocated pages.
    /// - To avoid rapid database growth, the system will sync data and issue a steady commit-point
    ///   to resume reuse pages, each time there is insufficient space and before increasing the
    ///   size of the file on disk.
    ///
    /// In other words, with
    /// [`SyncMode::SafeNoSync`] flag MDBX protects you from the whole database corruption, at the
    /// cost increasing database size and/or number of disk IOPs. So, [`SyncMode::SafeNoSync`]
    /// flag could be used with [`Environment::sync()`](crate::Environment::sync) as alternatively
    /// for batch committing or nested transaction (in some cases).
    ///
    /// The number and volume of of disk IOPs with [`SyncMode::SafeNoSync`] flag will exactly the
    /// as without any no-sync flags. However, you should expect a larger process's work set
    /// and significantly worse a locality of reference, due to the more intensive allocation
    /// of previously unused pages and increase the size of the database.
    SafeNoSync,

    /// Don't sync anything and wipe previous steady commits.
    ///
    /// Don't flush system buffers to disk when committing a transaction.
    /// This optimization means a system crash can corrupt the database, if buffers are not yet
    /// flushed to disk. Depending on the platform and hardware, with [`SyncMode::UtterlyNoSync`]
    /// you may get a multiple increase of write performance, even 100 times or more.
    ///
    /// If the filesystem preserves write order (which is rare and never provided unless explicitly
    /// noted) and the [`WriteMap`](crate::EnvironmentKind::WriteMap) and
    /// [`EnvironmentFlags::liforeclaim`] flags are not used, then a system crash can't corrupt
    /// the database, but you can lose the last transactions, if at least one buffer is not yet
    /// flushed to disk. The risk is governed by how often the system flushes dirty buffers to
    /// disk and how often [`Environment::sync()`](crate::Environment::sync) is called. So,
    /// transactions exhibit ACPI (atomicity, consistency, isolation) properties and only lose D
    /// (durability). I.e. database integrity is maintained, but a system crash may undo the
    /// final transactions.
    ///
    /// Otherwise, if the filesystem not preserves write order (which is typically) or
    /// [`WriteMap`](crate::EnvironmentKind::WriteMap) or [`EnvironmentFlags::liforeclaim`] flags
    /// are used, you should expect the corrupted database after a system crash.
    ///
    /// So, most important thing about [`SyncMode::UtterlyNoSync`]:
    /// - A system crash immediately after commit the write transaction high likely lead to
    ///   database corruption.
    /// - Successful completion of [`Environment::sync(force=true`)](crate::Environment::sync)
    ///   after one or more committed transactions guarantees consistency and durability.
    /// - BUT by committing two or more transactions you back database into a weak state, in which
    ///   a system crash may lead to database corruption! In case single transaction after
    ///   [`Environment::sync()`](crate::Environment::sync), you may lose transaction itself, but
    ///   not a whole database.
    ///
    /// Nevertheless, [`SyncMode::UtterlyNoSync`] provides "weak" durability in
    /// case of an application crash (but no durability on system failure), and therefore may
    /// be very useful in scenarios where data durability is not required over a system failure
    /// (e.g for short-lived data), or if you can take such risk.
