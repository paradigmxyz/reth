/// a block number or hash. However, it might be desirable to fetch receipts from a `BlockId` type,
/// which can be a number, hash, or tag such as `BlockNumberOrTag::Safe`.

/// Resolving tags requires keeping track of block hashes or block numbers associated with the tag,
/// so this trait can only be implemented for types that implement `BlockIdReader`. The
/// `BlockIdReader` methods should be used to resolve `BlockId`s to block numbers or hashes, and
/// retrieving the receipts should be done using the type's `ReceiptProvider` methods.
