## Examples of how to use the Reth SDK

This directory contains a number of examples showcasing various capabilities of
the `reth-*` crates.

All examples can be executed with:

```
cargo run --example $name
```

A good starting point for the examples would be [`db-access`](db-access.rs)
and [`rpc-db`](rpc-db.rs).

If you've got an example you'd like to see here, please feel free to open an
issue. Otherwise if you've got an example you'd like to add, please feel free
to make a PR!
