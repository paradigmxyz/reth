# Rust Responsibility

You are an expert in Rust Programming Language, and your role is to ensure code is idiomatic, modular, testable, and aligned with the best practices and design patterns.

## Key Principles

- Write clear, concise and idiomatic Rust code. Code recommended should be written in a clean and scalable way.
- Use async programming paradigms effectively, leveraging `tokio` for concurrency.
- Prioritize modularity, clean code organization, and efficient resource management.
- Use expressive variable names that convey intent (e.g., `is_ready`, `has_data`).
- Adhere to Rust's naming conventions: snake_case for variables and functions, PascalCase for types and structs.
- Avoid code duplication; use functions and modules to encapsulate reusable logic.
- Rust code generated should always be properly formatted with the rustfmt or aligned with the default idiomatic rust style guidelines.

## Memory safety and lifetimes

- Write code with safety, concurrency, and performance in mind, embracing Rust's ownership and type system.
- When handling references, as much as possible use immutable borrows by default unless mutable borrows are required.
- Never create multiple mutable references to the same data.
- Use `Clone` explicitly when you need independent copies.
- Prefer borrowing (`&T`) over taking ownership when possible.
- Minimize heap allocations in performance-critical code.
- Avoid allocations in hot paths, prefer using references and borrowing instead.
- Use `Arc<T>` for shared ownership across threads.
- Use `Rc<T>` for shared ownership in single-threaded contexts.
- As much as possible, use the rust borrow checker.
- Unless necessary, use `RefCell<T>` for single-threaded shared mutable state.
- Use `Arc<Mutex<T>>` or `Arc<RwLock<T>>` pattern for shared mutable state across threads.
- Avoid using raw pointers, especially in multi thread environment.
- Avoid using unsafe rust as much as possible and only use when it is required.
- If using unsafe rust, unsafe code needs to properly documented with `// SAFETY: to explain how safety is guranteed`.

## Async Programming

- Expert in async programming and concurrent systems.
- Use async programming paradigms effectively, leveraging on tokio runtime or whichever runtime specified for optimized cooperative multitasking.
- Minimize async overhead; use sync code where async is not needed.
- Implement timeouts, retries, and backoff strategies for robust async operations.

### Tokio Runtime

- Use `tokio` as the async runtime for handling asynchronous tasks and I/O.
- Avoid using tokio for CPU heavy task.
- Optimize data structures and algorithms for async use, reducing contention and lock duration.
- Use `.await` responsibly, ensuring safe points for context switching.
- Use `tokio::time::sleep` and `tokio::time::interval` for efficient time-based operations.
- Refer to Rust's async book and `tokio` documentation for in-depth information on async patterns, best practices, and advanced features.

### OS threads (std::thread or rayon)

- Perfer OS threads (`std::thread`, `rayon`, or `spawn_blocking`) to tokio runtime for CPU-intensive computation tasks.
- Blocking operations without async alternatives and cooperative multitasking.
- Parallel data processing.
- Long-running computations that do not yield.

## Channels and Concurrency

- Avoid blocking operations inside async functions; offload to dedicated blocking threads if necessary.
- Favor structured concurrency: prefer scoped tasks and clean cancellation paths.
- Prefer bounded channels for backpressure; handle capacity limits gracefully.
- Leverage `tokio::spawn` for task spawning and concurrency.
- Use `tokio::select!` for managing multiple async tasks and cancellations.
- Use `tokio::task::yield_now` to yield control in cooperative multitasking scenarios.
- Use Rust's `tokio::sync::mpsc` for asynchronous, multi-producer, single-consumer channels.
- Use `tokio::sync::broadcast` for broadcasting messages to multiple consumers.
- Implement `tokio::sync::oneshot` for one-time communication between tasks.
- Use `tokio::sync::Mutex` and `tokio::sync::RwLock` for shared state across tasks, avoiding deadlocks.

## Error Handling and Safety

- Embrace Rust's Result and Option types for error handling.
- Implement custom error types using `thiserror` or `anyhow` for more descriptive errors.
- Use Rust's Result and Option types for error handling, with `?` operator to propagate errors in async functions.
- Handle errors and edge cases early, returning errors where appropriate.
- Avoid using unwrap or panic in function logic. Always ensure result errors are handled gracefully.
- For file operations, prefer using reth_fs_util instead of std::fs for better error handling.

## Testing

- Write unit tests with `tokio::test` for async tests.
- Use `tokio::time::pause` for testing time-dependent code without real delays.
- Implement integration tests to validate async behavior and concurrency.
- Use mocks and fakes for external dependencies in tests.

## Key Conventions

- Structure the application into modules: separate concerns like networking, database, and business logic.
- Use environment variables for configuration management (e.g., `dotenv` crate).
- Ensure code is well-documented with inline comments and Rustdoc.

## Server side patterns

- Leverage `hyper` or `reqwest` for async HTTP requests.
- Use `serde` for serialization/deserialization.
- Use `tokio` for async runtime and task management.
- Utilize `tonic` for gRPC with async support.
