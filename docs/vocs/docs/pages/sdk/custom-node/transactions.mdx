# Custom transactions

In this chapter, we'll learn how to define custom crate-local transaction envelope types and configure our node to use it.
We'll extend it with a custom variant, implement custom processing logic and configure our custom node to use it.

All the while trying to minimize boilerplate, trivial, unnecessary or copy pasted code.

# Motivation

Historically, custom node operators were forced to fork the blockchain client repository they were working with if they
wanted to introduce complex custom changes beyond the scope of the vanilla node configuration. Forking represents a huge
maintenance burden due to the complexities of keeping the code up-to-date with the custom changes intact.

We introduced Reth SDK to address this widespread issue, where we operate in a continuous feed-back loop, continuously
shaping it to fit the needs of node operators.

Oftentimes we may want to preserve the full capabilities of an Ethereum blockchain but introduce a special transaction
that has different processing. For example, one may introduce a transaction type that does not invoke any EVM processing,
but still produces a new state, performing a computation at no gas cost.

# Type definition using declarative macro

We'll showcase the macro on the `custom-node` example in the `reth` repository.
Please refer to it to see the complete implementation.

## Introduction

In this example, we assume that we are building our node on top of an Optimism stack. But all the things we're doing are
analogous to the way you would build on top off an L1 node, for example. Just use Ethereum counterparts to the Optimism
ones.

## Dependencies

The transaction envelope macro resides in the `alloy_consensus` crate since version `1.0.10`. It's being consistently improved upon so it's recommended to use the latest version.
Since we're building on top of Optimism we will also need `op-alloy` that contains Optimism specific extensions.

```toml
# alloy
alloy-consensus = "1.0.24"
alloy-eips = "1.0.24"
alloy-evm = "1.0.24"
alloy-genesis = "1.0.24"
alloy-op-evm = "1.0.24"
alloy-primitives = "1.0.24"
alloy-rlp = "1.0.24"
alloy-serde = "1.0.24"
alloy-network = "1.0.24"
alloy-rpc-types-engine = "1.0.24"
alloy-rpc-types-eth = "1.0.24"
op-alloy-consensus = "0.18.14"
op-alloy-rpc-types-engine = "0.18.14"
op-alloy-rpc-types = "0.18.14"
```

There may be occasionally additional dependencies needed. Refer to the custom node example for a complete list: https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/blob/7d660b57b0f219899387a352de5ba517b6b08901/examples/custom-node/Cargo.toml

## Declaration

### Consensus

When one thinks of a transaction, usually they mean as it is defined in the consensus layer. There are however more
interpretations depending on context. We'll start with the consensus definition.

This definition is how the blockchain stores it, hence why a lot of the declarative properties relate to RLP encoding.
In the context of reth, the consensus definition is also adapted into the RPC API representation. Therefore it is also
being JSON encoded. And lastly, it is being stored in database, it uses `Compact` encoding, which is a custom reth
database encoding. This one needs to be implemented manually, but can reuse a lot of existing functionality. More on
that later on in this chapter.

Here is our top level consensus transaction envelope declaration:

```rust
use alloy_consensus::TransactionEnvelope;
use op_alloy_consensus::OpTxEnvelope;

/// Either [`OpTxEnvelope`] or [`CustomTransactionEnvelope`].
#[derive(Debug, Clone, TransactionEnvelope)]
#[envelope(tx_type_name = TxTypeCustom)]
pub enum CustomTransaction {
    /// A regular Optimism transaction as defined by [`OpTxEnvelope`].
    #[envelope(flatten)]
    Op(OpTxEnvelope),
    /// A [`TxPayment`] tagged with type 0x7E.
    #[envelope(ty = 42)]
    Payment(CustomTransactionEnvelope),
}
```

Few things to note here, let's start from up top. We added:
* `derive(TransactionEnvelope)` which generates a lot of derivable trait implementations for transaction envelope types.
* `derive(Debug, Clone)` which are necessary for this macro to work.
* The `envelope` attribute with parameter `tx_type_name` generates an enum with a given name, in our case `TxTypeCustom`. This enum contains a *flattened* list of transaction variants.
* The enum `CustomTransaction` is declared hence it remains a crate-local type, allowing us to implement methods and foreign traits for it, which is very useful.
* The enum has two variants:
  * `Op` the base regular Optimism transaction envelope.
  * `Payment` the custom extension we added.
* We can add more custom extensions if we need to by extending this enum with another variant.
* Both variants have `envelope` attribute telling the macro how to process them
  * The `flatten` parameter tells the macro to adapt all the variants of the wrapped type as the variants of this transaction.
    This affects the serialization of the transaction, making so that on the outside all the `OpTxEnvelope` encoded types can be deserialized into this one.
    It only works with already existing transaction envelope types.
  * The `ty` parameter sets the transaction numerical identifier for the serialization. It identifies the transaction
    variant during deserialization. It's important that this number fits into one byte and does not collide with
    identifier of any other transaction variant.

Here is our custom transaction variant declaration:

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize, Hash, Eq, PartialEq)]
pub struct CustomTransactionEnvelope {
    pub inner: Signed<TxPayment>,
}
```

No custom macros used here, but due to it being serialized in JSON, it needs to be `serde` compatible.

The `TxPayment` is our custom transaction representation. In our example, it is meant only for money transfers,
not for smart contract interaction. Therefore it needs fewer parameters and is smaller to encode.

```rust
#[derive(
    Clone,
    Debug,
    Default,
    PartialEq,
    Eq,
    Hash,
    serde::Serialize,
    serde::Deserialize,
    reth_codecs::Compact,
)]
#[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]
#[doc(alias = "PaymentTransaction", alias = "TransactionPayment", alias = "PaymentTx")]
pub struct TxPayment {
    /// EIP-155: Simple replay attack protection
    #[serde(with = "alloy_serde::quantity")]
    pub chain_id: ChainId,
    /// A scalar value equal to the number of transactions sent by the sender; formally Tn.
    #[serde(with = "alloy_serde::quantity")]
    pub nonce: u64,
    /// A scalar value equal to the maximum
    /// amount of gas that should be used in executing
    /// this transaction. This is paid up-front, before any
    /// computation is done and may not be increased
    /// later; formally Tg.
    #[serde(with = "alloy_serde::quantity", rename = "gas", alias = "gasLimit")]
    pub gas_limit: u64,
    /// A scalar value equal to the maximum
    /// amount of gas that should be used in executing
    /// this transaction. This is paid up-front, before any
    /// computation is done and may not be increased
    /// later; formally Tg.
    ///
    /// As ethereum circulation is around 120mil eth as of 2022 that is around
    /// 120000000000000000000000000 wei we are safe to use u128 as its max number is:
    /// 340282366920938463463374607431768211455
    ///
    /// This is also known as `GasFeeCap`
    #[serde(with = "alloy_serde::quantity")]
    pub max_fee_per_gas: u128,
    /// Max Priority fee that transaction is paying
    ///
    /// As ethereum circulation is around 120mil eth as of 2022 that is around
    /// 120000000000000000000000000 wei we are safe to use u128 as its max number is:
    /// 340282366920938463463374607431768211455
    ///
    /// This is also known as `GasTipCap`
    #[serde(with = "alloy_serde::quantity")]
    pub max_priority_fee_per_gas: u128,
    /// The 160-bit address of the message call’s recipient.
    pub to: Address,
    /// A scalar value equal to the number of Wei to
    /// be transferred to the message call’s recipient or,
    /// in the case of contract creation, as an endowment
    /// to the newly created account; formally Tv.
    pub value: U256,
}
```

## Pooled

Another important representation is the mempool one. This declaration should be made to contain any transaction that
users can submit into the node's mempool.

Here is the declaration:

```rust
use alloy_consensus::TransactionEnvelope;
use op_alloy_consensus::OpPooledTransaction;

#[derive(Clone, Debug, TransactionEnvelope)]
#[envelope(tx_type_name = CustomPooledTxType)]
pub enum CustomPooledTransaction {
    /// A regular Optimism transaction as defined by [`OpPooledTransaction`].
    #[envelope(flatten)]
    Op(OpPooledTransaction),
    /// A [`CustomTransactionEnvelope`] tagged with type 0x7E.
    #[envelope(ty = 42)]
    Payment(CustomTransactionEnvelope),
}
```

As you can see it is almost the same as the consensus one. The main difference is the use of `OpPooledTransaction`
as the base. This one does not contain the deposit transactions. In Optimism, deposits don't go into the mempool,
because they are not user-submitted, but rather received from the engine API that only the sequencer can use.

## Manual trait implementations

There are more traits to be implemented a lot of them are `reth` specific and due to the macro being defined in `alloy`,
it cannot provide these implementations automatically.

We'll dissect the several kinds of trait implementations you may encounter. To see the complete list refer to these
source code sections:
* Consensus envelope: https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/blob/c63459884e5988067b0b7a67362dd036f2085326/examples/custom-node/src/primitives/tx.rs#L43-L309
* Pooled envelope: https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/blob/cb42ac94b552fc798563ea9c383870dc3db99f4c/examples/custom-node/src/pool.rs#L21-L94
* Transaction: https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/blob/7349abd12639cebc7a5377a841376b0fd4781bcb/examples/custom-node/src/primitives/tx_custom.rs#L70-L288

Most of these implementations simply match the envelope enum variant and then delegate the responsibility to each variant, for example:

```rust
impl InMemorySize for CustomTransaction {
    fn size(&self) -> usize {
        match self {
            CustomTransaction::Op(tx) => InMemorySize::size(tx),
            CustomTransaction::Payment(tx) => InMemorySize::size(tx),
        }
    }
}
```

Some of these implementations are trivial, for example:

```rust
impl OpTransaction for CustomTransactionEnvelope {
    fn is_deposit(&self) -> bool {
        false
    }

    fn as_deposit(&self) -> Option<&Sealed<TxDeposit>> {
        None
    }
}
```

This one is simply saying that the custom transaction variant is not an optimism deposit.

A few of these trait implementations are a marker trait with no body like so:

```rust
impl RlpBincode for CustomTransaction {}
```

Sometimes the fact that `CustomTransactionEnvelope` is a wrapper type means that it needs to reimplement some traits that
it's `inner` field already implements, like so:

```rust
impl SignedTransaction for CustomTransactionEnvelope {
    fn tx_hash(&self) -> &TxHash {
        self.inner.hash()
    }
}
```

The `Compact` support is largely derived and abstracted away with the help of a few minimal trivial implementations. One
slightly interesting case is `FromTxCompact`. The actual decoding is delegated to `TxPayment`, where it is macro generated.
Then it is put together with the `signature`, that given as one of the function arguments, via `Signed::new_unhashed`
which creates the `Signed<TxPayment>` instance with no signature validation.

Since the signature validation is done before encoding it, it would be redundant and infallible, but still need a
`Result` type or an `unwrap`.

```rust
impl FromTxCompact for CustomTransactionEnvelope {
    type TxType = TxTypeCustom;

    fn from_tx_compact(buf: &[u8], _tx_type: Self::TxType, signature: Signature) -> (Self, &[u8])
    where
        Self: Sized,
    {
        let (tx, buf) = TxPayment::from_compact(buf, buf.len());
        let tx = Signed::new_unhashed(tx, signature);
        (CustomTransactionEnvelope { inner: tx }, buf)
    }
}
```

# Plugging it in

* Configure the node to use the custom type
* Implement components that work with transaction variants

## Recommended approach

## Implementing components
Usually this is where the most time is spent and most valuable code is written. But your mileage may vary.
