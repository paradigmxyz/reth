# Installation

Reth runs on Linux and macOS (Windows tracked).

There are three core methods to obtain Reth:

-   [Pre-built binaries](/installation/binaries)
-   [Docker images](/installation/docker)
-   [Building from source.](/installation/source)

:::note
If you have Docker installed, we recommend using the [Docker Compose](/installation/docker#using-docker-compose) configuration
that will get you Reth, Lighthouse (Consensus Client), Prometheus and Grafana running and syncing with just one command.
