# Update Priorities

When publishing releases, reth will include an "Update Priority" section in the release notes, in the same manner Lighthouse does.

The "Update Priority" section will include a table which may appear like so:

| User Class           | Priority        |
| -------------------- | --------------- |
| Payload Builders     | Medium Priority |
| Non-Payload Builders | Low Priority    |

To understand this table, the following terms are important:

-   _Payload builders_ are those who use reth to build and validate payloads.
-   _Non-payload builders_ are those who run reth for other purposes (e.g., data analysis, RPC or applications).
-   _High priority_ updates should be completed as soon as possible (e.g., hours or days).
-   _Medium priority_ updates should be completed at the next convenience (e.g., days or a week).
-   _Low priority_ updates should be completed in the next routine update cycle (e.g., two weeks).
