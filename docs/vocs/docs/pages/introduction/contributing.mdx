## Repository and Project Structure

Reth is organized as a modular codebase with clear separation and a contributor friendly architecture, you can read about it in detail [here](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/tree/main/docs). Here's the TL;DR:

### Design

Reth follows a modular architecture where each component can be used independently:

-   **Consensus**: Block validation and consensus rules
-   **Storage**: Hybrid database with MDBX + static files
-   **Networking**: P2P networking stack
-   **RPC**: JSON-RPC server implementation
-   **Engine**: Consensus layer integration
-   **EVM**: Transaction execution
-   **Node Builder**: High-level orchestration

### Crates

The repository is organized into focused crates under `/crates/`:

```
crates/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ consensus/          # Consensus and validation logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ storage/           # Database and storage implementations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ net/               # Networking components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ rpc/               # JSON-RPC server and APIs
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ engine/            # Engine API and consensus integration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ evm/               # EVM execution
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ node/              # Node building and orchestration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ethereum/          # Ethereum-specific implementations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ optimism/          # Optimism L2 support
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

## Workflow: The Lifecycle of PRs

### 1. Before You Start

-   Check existing issues to avoid duplicate work
-   For large features, open an issue first to discuss the approach
-   Fork the repository and create a feature branch

### 2. Development Process

#### Setting Up Your Environment

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/reth.git
cd reth

# Install dependencies and tools
# Use nightly Rust for formatting
rustup install nightly
rustup component add rustfmt --toolchain nightly

# Run the validation suite
make pr
```

#### Code Style and Standards

-   **Formatting**: Use nightly rustfmt (`cargo +nightly fmt`)
-   **Linting**: All clippy warnings must be addressed
-   **Documentation**: Add doc comments for public APIs
-   **Testing**: Include appropriate tests for your changes

#### Recommended VS Code Settings

Install the `rust-analyzer` extension and use these settings for the best development experience:

```json
{
    "rust-analyzer.rustfmt.overrideCommand": ["rustfmt", "+nightly"],
    "rust-analyzer.check.overrideCommand": [
        "cargo",
        "clippy",
        "--workspace",
        "--message-format=json",
        "--all-targets",
        "--all-features"
    ]
}
```

### 3. Testing Your Changes

Reth uses comprehensive testing at multiple levels:

#### Unit Tests

Test specific functions and components:

```bash
cargo test --package reth-ethereum-consensus
```

#### Integration Tests

Test component interactions:

```bash
cargo test --test integration_tests
```

#### Full Test Suite

Run all tests including Ethereum Foundation tests:

```bash
make test
```

#### Validation Suite

Before submitting, always run:

```bash
make pr
```

This runs:

-   Code formatting checks
-   Clippy linting
-   Documentation generation
-   Full test suite

### 4. Submitting Your PR

#### Draft PRs for Large Features

For substantial changes, open a draft PR early to get feedback on the approach.

#### PR Requirements

-   [ ] Clear, descriptive title and description
-   [ ] Tests for new functionality
-   [ ] Documentation updates if needed
-   [ ] All CI checks passing
-   [ ] Commit messages follow conventional format

#### Commit Message Format

```
type: brief description

More detailed explanation if needed.

- feat: new feature
- fix: bug fix
- docs: documentation changes
- refactor: code refactoring
- test: adding tests
- chore: maintenance tasks
```
