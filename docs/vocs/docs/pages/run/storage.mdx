# Storage Configuration

Reth uses a hybrid storage approach with MDBX as the primary database and optional RocksDB for specific tables. This page documents how to configure which tables are stored in RocksDB.

## Overview

By default, all tables are stored in MDBX. However, certain large tables can benefit from RocksDB's performance characteristics. Storage settings allow you to route specific tables to RocksDB for improved performance on high-throughput workloads.

:::warning
These settings can only be configured at genesis initialization. Once the node has been initialized, changing these settings requires a full re-sync from scratch.

## RocksDB CLI Flags

### `--rocksdb.tx-hash`

Route the transaction hash to number mapping table to RocksDB instead of MDBX.

```bash
reth node --rocksdb.tx-hash=true
```

**Default:** `false` (stored in MDBX)

**Use case:** This table maps transaction hashes to their sequential transaction IDs. Moving it to RocksDB can improve lookup performance for high-volume transaction queries.

### `--rocksdb.storages-history`

Route storage history tables to RocksDB instead of MDBX.

```bash
reth node --rocksdb.storages-history=true
```

**Default:** `false` (stored in MDBX)

**Use case:** Storage history tracks historical values of contract storage slots. This table can grow very large on archive nodes. RocksDB may provide better write performance for this workload.

### `--rocksdb.account-history`

Route account history tables to RocksDB instead of MDBX.

```bash
reth node --rocksdb.account-history=true
```

**Default:** `false` (stored in MDBX)

**Use case:** Account history tracks historical account states. Similar to storage history, this table grows significantly on archive nodes and may benefit from RocksDB's handling of large datasets.

## Example

```bash
reth node --rocksdb.tx-hash=true --rocksdb.storages-history=true --rocksdb.account-history=true
```

## RocksDB Data Directory

When using RocksDB tables, the data is stored in a separate directory. You can customize this location using the `--datadir.rocksdb` flag:

```bash
reth node --datadir.rocksdb /path/to/rocksdb
```

If not specified, RocksDB data is stored in a subdirectory of your main data directory.

## When to Use RocksDB Tables

Consider enabling RocksDB for specific tables when:

- Running an **archive node** with full historical data
- Experiencing **write performance bottlenecks** with large history tables
- Performing **high-volume transaction lookups** that stress the transaction hash table

For most use cases, the default MDBX configuration provides excellent performance. Only enable RocksDB tables if you have measured performance issues with specific workloads.

## Migration Notes

Since these settings are genesis-only:

1. **New nodes:** Configure storage settings before first sync
2. **Existing nodes:** Requires full re-sync to change storage settings
3. **Backup:** Always backup your data before re-syncing

The storage settings are persisted to ensure consistency across restarts. Attempting to start a node with different storage settings than what was used during initialization will result in an error.
