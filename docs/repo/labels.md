## Labels

Each label in the repository has a description attached that describes what the label means.

There are 7 label categories in the repository:

- **Area labels**: These labels denote the general area of the project an issue or PR affects. These start with [`A-`][area].
- **Category labels**: These labels denote the type of issue or change being made, for example https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/labels/C-bug or https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/labels/C-enhancement. These start with [`C-`][category].
- **Difficulty labels**: These are reserved for the very easy or very hard issues. Any issue without one of these labels can be considered to be of "average difficulty". They start with [`D-`][difficulty].
- **Meta labels**: These start with [`M-`][meta] and convey meaning to the core contributors, usually about the release process.
- **Platform labels**: These describe the platform an issue is present on. They start with [`O-`][platform].
- **Priority labels**: These are reserved for issues that require more immediate attention (high priority and critical priority) and they start with [`P-`][priority].
- **Status labels**: These labels convey meaning to contributors about an issue or PR's status, e.g. whether they are blocked or need triage. They start with [`S-`][status].
- **EIP/network upgrade labels**: These labels are attached to PRs and issues related to specific EIPs or network upgrades. They start with [`E-`][eip]
