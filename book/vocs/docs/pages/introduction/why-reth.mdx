# Why Reth?

Reth is more than just another Ethereum client—it's the foundation upon which the next generation of blockchain infrastructure is being built. From powering production staking environments at institutions like Coinbase to enabling cutting-edge L2 sequencers and ZK applications, Reth represents the convergence of security, performance, and extensibility that the ecosystem demands.

Every piece of crypto infrastructure will be touching Reth one way or another. Here's why the world's leading developers and institutions are choosing Reth as their node of choice.

## Institutional-Grade Security

Reth secures real value on Ethereum mainnet today, trusted by institutions like [Coinbase](https://x.com/CoinbasePltfrm/status/1933546893742579890) for production staking infrastructure. It powers RPC providers such as Alchemy.

## Future Proof Performance

Reth pushes the performance frontier across every dimension, from L2 sequencers to MEV block building.

-   **L2 Sequencer Performance**: Used by [Base](https://www.base.org/), other production L2s and also rollup-as-a-service providers such as [Conduit](https://conduit.xyz) which require high throughput and fast block times.
-   **MEV & Block Building**: [rbuilder](https://github.com/flashbots/rbuilder) is an open-source implementation of a block builder built on Reth due to developer friendless and blazing fast performance.

## Infinitely Customizable

Reth's modular architecture means you are not locked into someone else's design decisions—build exactly the chain you need.

-   **Component-Based Design**: Swap out consensus, execution, mempool, or networking modules independently
-   **Custom Transaction Types**: Build specialized DeFi chains, and unique economic models
-   **Rapid Development**: Reth SDK accelerates custom blockchain development with pre-built components

## ZK & Stateless Ready

Reth is designed from the ground up to excel in the zero-knowledge future with stateless execution and modular architecture.

[SP1](https://github.com/succinctlabs/sp1), a zkVM for proving arbitrary Rust programs, and [Ress](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2025/03/stateless-reth-nodes), an experimental stateless node, demonstrate how Reth enables scalable zero-knowledge applications for Ethereum.

## Thriving Open Source Ecosystem

The most important factor in Reth's success is our vibrant open source community building the future together.

500+ geo-distributed developers from leading companies and academia have played a role to build Reth into what it is today.

## Join the community

Reth isn't just a tool—it's a movement toward better blockchain infrastructure. Whether you're running a validator, building the next generation of L2s, or creating cutting-edge ZK applications, Reth provides the foundation you need to succeed.
