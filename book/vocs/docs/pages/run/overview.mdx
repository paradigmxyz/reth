# Run a Node

Congratulations, now that you have installed Reth, it's time to run it!

In this chapter we'll go through a few different topics you'll encounter when running Reth, including:

1. [Running on mainnet or official testnets](/run/ethereum)
1. [Running on OP Stack chains](/run/opstack)
1. [Logs and Observability](/run/monitoring)
1. [Configuring reth.toml](/run/configuration)
1. [Transaction types](/run/faq/transactions)
1. [Pruning & Full Node](/run/faq/pruning)
1. [Ports](/run/faq/ports)
1. [Troubleshooting](/run/faq/troubleshooting)

In the future, we also intend to support the [OP Stack](https://docs.optimism.io/get-started/superchain), which will allow you to run Reth as a Layer 2 client. More there soon!
