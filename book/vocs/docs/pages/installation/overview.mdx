# Installation

Reth runs on Linux and macOS (Windows tracked).

There are three core methods to obtain Reth:

-   [Pre-built binaries](./binaries)
-   [Docker images](./docker)
-   [Building from source.](./source)

:::note
If you have Docker installed, we recommend using the [Docker Compose](./docker#using-docker-compose) configuration
that will get you Reth, Lighthouse (Consensus Client), Prometheus and Grafana running and syncing with just one command.
