# Introduction

Reth is a user-friendly, modular, fast, and efficient Ethereum full node implementation that is compatible with the [Engine API](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/tree/main/src/engine). It allows users to connect to the Ethereum network and interact with the blockchain, including sending and receiving transactions and accessing smart contracts. Reth is built and maintained by [Paradigm](https://www.paradigm.xyz/) and is licensed under the Apache and MIT licenses.

## Status

The project is not ready for use. We hope to have full sync implemented sometime in January/February 2023, followed by optimizations. In the meantime, we're working on making sure every crate of the repository is well documented, abstracted and tested.
