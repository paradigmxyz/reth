# Developers

Reth is composed of several crates that can be used in standalone projects. If you are interested in using one or more of the crates, you can get an overview of them in the [developer docs](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/tree/main/docs), or take a look at the [crate docs](https://paradigmxyz.github.io/reth/docs).
