Usage: reth debug [OPTIONS] <COMMAND>

Commands:
  execution         Debug the roundtrip execution of blocks as well as the generated data
  merkle            Debug the clean & incremental state root calculations
  in-memory-merkle  Debug in-memory state root calculation
  build-block       Debug block building
  replay-engine     Debug engine API by replaying stored messages
  help              Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
      --chain <CHAIN_OR_PATH>
          The chain this node is running.
          Possible values are either a built-in chain or the path to a chain specification file.

          Built-in chains:
              mainnet, sepolia, holesky, dev

          [default: mainnet]

      --instance <INSTANCE>
          Add a new instance of a node.

          Configures the ports of the node to avoid conflicts with the defaults. This is useful for running multiple nodes on the same machine.

          Max number of instances is 200. It is chosen in a way so that it's not possible to have port numbers that conflict with each other.

          Changes to the following port numbers: - `DISCOVERY_PORT`: default + `instance` - 1 - `AUTH_PORT`: default + `instance` * 100 - 100 - `HTTP_RPC_PORT`: default - `instance` + 1 - `WS_RPC_PORT`: default + `instance` * 2 - 2
