# Run a Node

Congratulations, now that you have installed Reth, it's time to run it!

In this chapter we'll go through a few different topics you'll encounter when running Reth, including:
1. [Running on mainnet or official testnets](./mainnet.md)
1. [Running on OP Stack chains](./optimism.md)
1. [Logs and Observability](./observability.md)
1. [Configuring reth.toml](./config.md)
1. [Transaction types](./transactions.md)
1. [Pruning & Full Node](./pruning.md)
1. [Ports](./ports.md)
1. [Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting.md)

In the future, we also intend to support the [OP Stack](https://docs.optimism.io/get-started/superchain), which will allow you to run Reth as a Layer 2 client. More there soon!
