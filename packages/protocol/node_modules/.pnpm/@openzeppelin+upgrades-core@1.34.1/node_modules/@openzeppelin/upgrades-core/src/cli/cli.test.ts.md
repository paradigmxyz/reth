    `Usage: npx @openzeppelin/upgrades-core validate [<BUILD_INFO_DIR>] [<OPTIONS>]␊
    ␊
    Detects upgradeable contracts from a build info directory and validates whether they are upgrade safe.␊
    ␊
    Arguments:␊
      <BUILD_INFO_DIR>  Optional path to the build info directory which contains JSON files with Solidity compiler input and output. Defaults to 'artifacts/build-info' for Hardhat projects or 'out/build-info' for Foundry projects. If your project uses a custom output directory, you must specify its build info directory here.␊
    ␊
    Options:␊
      --contract <CONTRACT>  The name or fully qualified name of the contract to validate. If not specified, all upgradeable contracts in the build info directory will be validated.␊
      --reference <REFERENCE_CONTRACT>  Can only be used when the --contract option is also provided. The name or fully qualified name of the reference contract to use for storage layout comparisons. If not specified, uses the @custom:oz-upgrades-from annotation if it is defined in the contract that is being validated.␊
      --requireReference  Can only be used when the --contract option is also provided. Not compatible with --unsafeSkipStorageCheck. If specified, requires either the --reference option to be provided or the contract to have a @custom:oz-upgrades-from annotation.␊
      --unsafeAllow "<VALIDATION_ERRORS>"  Selectively disable one or more validation errors. Comma-separated list with one or more of the following: state-variable-assignment, state-variable-immutable, external-library-linking, struct-definition, enum-definition, constructor, delegatecall, selfdestruct, missing-public-upgradeto, internal-function-storage␊
      --unsafeAllowRenames  Configure storage layout check to allow variable renaming.␊
      --unsafeSkipStorageCheck  Skips checking for storage layout compatibility errors. This is a dangerous option meant to be used as a last resort.␊
