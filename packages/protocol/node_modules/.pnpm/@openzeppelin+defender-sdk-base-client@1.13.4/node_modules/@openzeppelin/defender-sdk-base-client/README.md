# Defender Base Client

The OpenZeppelin Defender provides a security operations (SecOps) platform for Ethereum with built-in best practices. Development teams implement Defender to ship faster and minimize security risks.

Certain components of Defender, such as Monitors or Relay, can be interacted with programmatically via an API. This library provides the base class for the clients.
