### Describe the change

- [x] some links still lead to the books url, we should remove all of those
- [x] re-brand from book to docs in the internal repo structure
- [x] serve rustdocs
- [x] re-work the system req section, I believe this is outdated https://yash-atreya.github.io/reth/run/system-requirements#what-hardware-can-i-get 
- [x] communicate disk requirements nuance in system req i.e the history can be stored on different drives
- [x] supported networks
