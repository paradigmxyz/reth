### Describe the feature

We just seen erigon just merge a PR to allow you with a single RPC request to modify the contract injecting your own events and get the new logs back.. more information on the feature: https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon/pull/9438

This is making people who switched from erigon to reth going back purely for how strong this feature is. 

Would be cool to see it here!
