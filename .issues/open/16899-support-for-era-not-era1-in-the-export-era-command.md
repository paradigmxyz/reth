### Describe the feature

Currently, exporting ERA1 files is an in-progress issue #15909 which will spawn a follow-up where a CLI command is introduced.

The goal of this task is to introduce a CLI command for exporting the ERA (not ERA1) files. It might make sense to have the ERA1 and ERA support in one command such as `export-era`.
